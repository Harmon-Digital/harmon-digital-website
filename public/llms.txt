> Sell your business for more. We only win when you do.

Harmon Digital systematizes owner-dependent businesses so buyers pay a premium—not a discount. We build custom automation, AI agents, and documentation that let the business run without you. Our fee: $2,500/month retainer during the build + 8% of the valuation increase at closing.

## Pricing

Exit Systematization: $2,500/month retainer (3-6 months depending on build complexity) + 8% of valuation increase (paid at closing). Full operational systematization, AI agents, automation, complete documentation. For businesses actively preparing to sell.
